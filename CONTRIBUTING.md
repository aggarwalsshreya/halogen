# Welcome to halogen!

_This guide will walk you through the steps you need to take to start contributing to this repo!_

> First up, this codebase is designed to be **approachable**. If you have a question, please ask! If you would like to try something out, open an issue and tell us about it! 


---

## First Contribution

* **First up, if you haven't already, make sure to `fork` this repository** 

  _This is the first step in the open source development workflow._
>
* **Clone the repository down to your computer**

  * _(more details on `fork` and `clone` are in the [README.md](README.md) file)_
>
* **Find an issue to work on**

  Navigate to the `issues` tab, and see if any of the current unassigned issues look like something you'd like to tackle. If one catches your eye, open it up and add a comment requesting that it gets assigned to you.
  * _If you're really feeling lost, but would like to get your feet wet just a little bit, go ahead and create an issue using the **[Beginner help](https://github.com/developer-delta/halogen/issues/new?assignees=&labels=beginner-work-wanted&template=beginner-help.md&title=Entry-level+story+requested)** template_.
>
* **Wait to be assigned requested issue**

  If you selected an issue that was not assigned to someone else and had no comments on it, you can probably safely move forward to the next steps, but if you want to be certain someone else isn't doing the same work, you should wait to be assigned, it won't take long!
>
* **Create a feature branch for the work you will be doing**
  ```shell
  git checkout -b your-cool-branch-name
  ```

* **Make code changes**
  ```javascript
  console.log("You're doing it!");
  ```
* **Add the files you made changes to**
  ```shell
  git add changed-file1.html
  git add changed-file2.js
  git add changed-file3.css
  ```

* **Commit your code changes**
  ```shell 
  git commit -m "finished my feature work"
  ```

* **Push your changes up to your feature branch**
  ```shell
  git push --set-upstream origin your-cool-branch-name
  ```
  * **NOTE**: You only need `--set-upstream origin branch-name` the _first_ time you push to a new branch. Subsequent pushes to that branch can just use `git push`.
>
* **Submit a pull request**

  Back in GitHub, navigate to your forked `halogen` repository, and you should see a new banner on the page that says `your-cool-branch-name had recent pushes`, and a button to create a PR. Go ahead and click it.

  Make sure to name your PR `closes developer-delta/halogen#[issue-number]`.
