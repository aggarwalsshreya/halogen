Getting into open-source can be nerve-wracking! Don't let the imposter syndrome get you down. There is no judgement here at all, and we welcome every skill level, even if you just started out. So go ahead and add this issue if you need help getting the ball rolling.

Feel free to list some things you'd like to practice, or enjoy working on, like nesting `HTML` tags, creating `CSS` rules, or `JS` for loops. We'll find something just right for you.
